# Dialog_For_Alert

Using a dialog to request a user's choice.
Such as an alert requires the user to tap OK or Cancel.
A dialog is a window that appears on top of the display or fills the display, interrupting the flow of activity.
In this practical, a Button is used to trigger a standard alert dialog. 
In a real-world app, you might trigger an alert dialog based on some condition, or based on the user tapping something.
Also note: Use dialogs sparingly, because they interrupt the user's workflow.
